## MacOS

### OpenFLUID 2.1.5+

!!! warning
    Since OpenFLUID 2.1.5, the macOS installation relies on the [Brew packaging tool](https://brew.sh/).  
    It is still an unstable packaging, and is available only for macOS 10.14 _Mojave_ and 10.15 _Catalina_


Install Brew (_Task to perform only once, see also [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)_)
```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Add OpenFLUID tap for Brew _(Task to perform only once)_
```sh
brew tap OpenFLUID/openfluid
```

Install OpenFLUID using Brew (with `--no-quarantine` option to avoid Gatekeeper restrictions in recent MacOS versions)
```sh
brew cask install --no-quarantine openfluid
```


### OpenFLUID 2.1.3 - 2.1.4

!!! warning
    The OSX installer is only available for OpenFLUID 2.1.3 and later versions.  
    It is still an early preview release, and has only been tested on macOS 10.11

1) Download the [OpenFLUID .dmg file](http://www.openfluid-project.org/downloads/) and mount it in the Finder.  

2) Read installation instructions. Notice brew dependencies.  

3) Install the OpenFLUID package  

4) If you plan to develop your own simulators, you have to install Xcode and Xcode Command line Tools  


## Windows

1) Download [OpenFLUID for Windows](http://www.openfluid-project.org/downloads/) and install it using the automatic installer. This installer includes the required libraries and sets the required environment variables for OpenFLUID.

2) Check the installation by typing the following command in a command prompt
```sh
 openfluid --version
```

3) If you plan to use advanced OpenFLUID observers or develop your own simulators, observers or builder-extensions: you are really encouraged to download and install these additional support tools for Windows, available from the [OpenFLUID downloads page](http://www.openfluid-project.org/downloads/).

### For older versions or custom install
Instead of the OpenFLUID-support installer, you may want to install dependencies by yourself (this part is not up to date anymore in 2024)

* Install the [Qt 5.9.6 package for Windows](http://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.9/5.9.6/qt-opensource-windows-x86-5.9.6.exe). During the installation process, select MinGW 5.3 32bits in `Qt > Qt5.9.6` and `Qt > Tools` sections
* Install the [CMake tool for Windows](http://www.cmake.org/download/)
* Open the OpenFLUID-DevStudio application, go to the _Edit > Preferences..._ menu. In the preferences dialog, go to the _Development tools_ section and run the Qt detection process by using the _Detect Qt development tools (MinGW)_ button.


## Containers

OpenFLUID can be used through containerization (Operating-system-level virtualization), using Docker or Singularity software.  


### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images and usage instructions are available on Docker Hub : [https://hub.docker.com/r/openfluid/openfluid/](https://hub.docker.com/r/openfluid/openfluid/).  
<br/>
To use these images, the Docker container platform is required. Installation intructions are available at [https://docs.docker.com/install/](https://docs.docker.com/install/)


### Singularity

[Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) images uses Docker images hosted on Docker Hub.
To build a Singularity image based on the latest OpenFLUID version, run the following command (with sudo if needed)
```sh
singularity build <imgfile> docker://openfluid/openfluid
```
*(Replace `<imgfile>` by the filename of the image to build, e.g. openfluid.img)*  
<br/>

To build a Singularity image based on a specific OpenFLUID version, run the following command (with sudo if needed)
```sh
singularity build <imgfile> docker://openfluid/openfluid:<tag>
```
*(Replace `<tag>` by the specific OpenFLUID version tag for the image to build, e.g. `2.1.9`. Available tags are listed on [https://hub.docker.com/r/openfluid/openfluid/](https://hub.docker.com/r/openfluid/openfluid/))*  
<br/>

Once the image is created, use the `singularity shell` command or execute the image from the command line
```sh
singularity shell <imgfile>
```
or
```sh
./<imgfile>
```  
<br/>
Installation instructions for Singularity are available at [https://sylabs.io/docs/](https://sylabs.io/docs/)
