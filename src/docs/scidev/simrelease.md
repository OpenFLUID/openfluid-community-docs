!!! warning "Warning"
    This page is currently under maintenance to be updated with new signature system.

In order to help developers in their simulators release process, a procedure which enlists the items to check for a developed simulator is proposed and allows developers to check points like:

* Is the documentation provided with my simulator enough ?
* Is the signature of my simulator complete ?
* Should I provide complete tests if my simulator is still experimental ?
* ...

Three level of maturity of a developed simulator are identified by three status : **experimental**, **beta** and **stable**.

For each level a sheet is available for download and allows the user to check the minimal requirements for passing the desired status.


### Experimental Status

The **Experimental** status corresponds to the first development level of a simulator. The development of the simulator is not still finished but has been focused on the simulator core.  It is still enough to use it for first analyses on its behaviour and results during simulations.

In order to match the experimental status requirements, at least the main following items must be checked:

* the source code must be built on one operating system at least,
* a brief description of the simulator is needed.

The form for **Experimental** status is available [here](http://www.openfluid-project.org/resources/docs/misc/LISAH_DOC_REF_OpenFLUID_Validation_Simulator_EXPERIMENTAL_STATUS.pdf)


### Beta Status

The **Beta** status corresponds to a level where the simulator core is quite stable and developments are more focused on source code stability and errors management. Few tests have been made on several datasets.

In order to match the beta status requirements, at least the main following items must be checked:
* must be compliant with Experimental status,
* the source code must be built on two operating systems,
* more complete documentation must be provided,
* tests had to be made.

The form for **Beta** status is available [here](http://www.openfluid-project.org/resources/docs/misc/LISAH_DOC_REF_OpenFLUID_Validation_Simulator_BETA_STATUS.pdf)


### Stable Status

The **Stable** status corresponds to the final level: the simulator is provided with a user license, full documentation and behaviour tests.

In order to match the stable status requirements, at least the main following items must be checked:

* must be compliant with Beta status,
* the signature of the simulator must be complete,
* coding style had to be respected,
* documentation in sim2doc must be provided,
* unitary tests and calculation time tests must be provided.

The form for **Stable** status is available [here](http://www.openfluid-project.org/resources/docs/misc/LISAH_DOC_REF_OpenFLUID_Validation_Simulator_STABLE_STATUS.pdf)
